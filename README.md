# Data Augmentation using DCGANs for Covid-19 detection in X-Ray images
In this Project we apply and assess data augmentation via Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs) to X-Ray images of lungs who were classified either as Covid-19 positive or negative. 
To study the efficiency of data augmentation in this case, we used a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the  images.
